# GitHub OAuth Authentication Improvements ðŸš€

## What Changed

I've successfully converted your extension from manual GitHub token authentication to VS Code's built-in OAuth authentication. This resolves the issue where the browser opened for token generation but VS Code didn't wait for your return.

## Key Improvements

### âœ… Seamless OAuth Flow
- Uses VS Code's native GitHub authentication provider
- No more manual token copying and pasting
- Automatic token management and renewal
- Proper session handling

### âœ… Better User Experience  
- Single click authentication through VS Code's UI
- Integrates with existing GitHub accounts in VS Code
- No more browser/VS Code context switching issues
- Automatic sign-out capability

### âœ… Enhanced Security
- VS Code handles token storage securely
- Proper OAuth scopes (`repo` access only)
- Session-based authentication
- Automatic token refresh

## How It Works Now

1. **Authentication**: When you run "Configure GitHub Repository", VS Code will show its native GitHub authentication dialog
2. **Authorization**: You'll see a standard OAuth consent screen asking for repository access
3. **Automatic Setup**: Once authorized, the extension immediately has access without manual token handling
4. **Session Management**: VS Code manages the session lifecycle automatically

## New Commands Available

- **Copilot Prompt Tracker: Sign Out from GitHub** - Clean sign out when needed

## Technical Changes

- Removed manual token prompting
- Implemented `vscode.authentication.getSession('github', ['repo'])`
- Added proper session management
- Updated package.json with `onAuthenticationRequest:github` activation
- Enhanced error handling for authentication failures

## Debug Testing

The new OAuth flow is now active in your Extension Development Host. Try these commands:

1. **Copilot Prompt Tracker: Configure GitHub Repository** - Test the new OAuth flow
2. **Copilot Prompt Tracker: Sign Out from GitHub** - Test session clearing
3. Any other commands will trigger authentication if needed

Watch the debug console for authentication status messages!
